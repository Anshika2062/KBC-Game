# KBC-Game

This is a simple implementation of the Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) game using Python lists. The program simulates a quiz game where players answer questions at different levels to win virtual prize money.

## How to Play

1. Run the `kbc.py` script using a Python interpreter.

2. You will be presented with a series of questions at different levels. Choose the correct answer by entering the corresponding option (A/B/C/D) and pressing Enter.

3. For each correct answer, you will win a certain amount of prize money. The prize money increases with each level.

4. If you answer a question incorrectly, the game ends, and you will be informed of the total prize money you won.


## Lists Used

1. `questions`: A list containing the questions for each level.

2. `options`: A list of lists containing the options corresponding to each question.

3. `answers`: A list containing the index of the correct option for each question.

4. `prize_money`: A list containing the prize money for each level.
